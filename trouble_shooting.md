## Razor IMU set up guide
- The following steps avoid some bugs in ROS Wiki. When you have a new Sparkfun 9DoF Razor IMU M0:

  1-1. Follow the guide by Sparkfun [here](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/9dof-razor-imu-m0-hookup-guide).
  
  *from "Installing the 9DoF Razor Arduino Core" to "Select the Board and Serial Port"*
  
  1-2. Then follow the guide by ROS Wiki [here](http://wiki.ros.org/razor_imu_9dof).
  
  *from "4.1 Install ROS razor_imu_9dof Package" to "4.2 Load Firmware into Razor Board"*
  
  *NOTICE: The instruction from ROS Wiki "Go to "Tools" â†’ "Board" and select "Arduino Pro or Pro Mini (3.3v, 8mhz) w/ATmega328"" is deadly wrong. You should instead select "Sparkfun 9DoF Razor IMU M0".*
  
  1-3. Before you compile and upload: Download SparkFun_MPU-9250-DMP_Arduino_Library (dowload .zip file from github)
  
  1-4. (In Arduino IDE) sketch -> Include library -> Add ZIP library
  
  1-5. Now you can compile and upload the firmware to the IMU.
  
  

## Razor IMU set up error (in Arduino IDE)
- This happends when following http://wiki.ros.org/razor_imu_9dof

  1-1. Download SparkFun_MPU-9250-DMP_Arduino_Library (dowload .zip file from github)
  
  1-2. (In Arduino IDE) sketch -> Include library -> Add ZIP library

  2-1. In Razor-AHRS.ino:
```
#define LOG_PORT Serial
/*
#if HW__VERSION_CODE == 14001
// Set your port used to send out data here!
#define LOG_PORT SERIAL_PORT_USBVIRTUAL
#else
// Set your port used to send out data here!
#define LOG_PORT Serial
#endif // HW__VERSION_CODE
*/
```

## mrpt_package cannot be installed

- **If [the fellowing](https://github.com/MRPT/mrpt/issues/682) error occour**
```
The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 mrpt-apps : Depends: libmrpt-graphslam1.9 but it is not going to be installed
             Depends: libmrpt-gui1.9 but it is not going to be installed
             Depends: libmrpt-hmtslam1.9 but it is not going to be installed
             Depends: libmrpt-hwdrivers1.9 but it is not going to be installed
             Depends: libstdc++6 (>= 6) but 5.4.0-6ubuntu1~16.04.9 is to be installed
             Recommends: mrpt-common (= 1:1.9.9~snapshot20180311-0737-git-4acd71ce-xenial-1~ppa1~xenial) but it is not going to be installed
E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.
```
  
  1. Install gcc-7 packages (see this gist):
  ```
       sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
       sudo apt update
       sudo apt install g++-7 -y
  ```
## **gazebo simulator** cannot open world

- **error [parser.cc:581] Unable to find uri[model://racecar_description/models/some_model_here]**
  
  1. export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH by adding:
  ```
      export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=/home/liuyc/SOLab/solabot_simulator/src/racecar_description/models:$GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH
  ```  
     to /.bashrc  
     
  2. also move the models to "/.gazebo/models" folder directly   
  3. and include the URI in launch file

## ROS package source failure

- **After editting `~/.bashrc`, sourced packages are not shown in `$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH`**

> When you first run catkin_make in the root of a workspace, the devel directory gets created and the setup.bash file inside of that dir is designed to "overlay" the workspace on top of all other workspaces that have already been sourced. It is quite common to have many "active" workspaces at a single time. [see this discussion](https://answers.ros.org/question/205976/sourcing-from-multiple-workspaces/)
    
   In short, when doing the `catkin_make`, `setup.bash` in the `devel` will do the the overlay of workspaces on top of the **current** `$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH`.
